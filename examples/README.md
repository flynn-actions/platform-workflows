# Platform Workflow Usage Examples

This directory contains example workflows showing how consumer organizations should use the platform engineering workflows and actions.

## üöÄ Quick Start for Consumer Teams

### 1. Copy Example Workflow
Choose the appropriate example for your team:
- **Frontend Teams**: Copy `frontend-ci-cd.yml` to `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` in your repository
- **Backend Teams**: Copy `backend-ci-cd.yml` to `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` in your repository  
- **Container-Only**: Copy `container-only.yml` for simple container builds

### 2. Configure Secrets
Add these secrets to your repository settings:
- `DEPLOY_TOKEN` - Your deployment token
- `SONAR_TOKEN` - SonarQube token (optional)
- `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` - Teams notification webhook (optional)

### 3. Customize Configuration
Modify the workflow inputs to match your application:
- `environment` - Target environment (dev, staging, prod)
- `node_version` - Node.js version for your app
- `run_tests` - Whether to run tests
- `deploy` - Whether to deploy
